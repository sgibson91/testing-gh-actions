# What happens if you reference github.head_ref on a push trigger,
# given that it is only available on a pull_request trigger
#
# Observations:
# - referencing head_ref in a push doesn't cause a failure, it just
#   doesn't come up
# - if head_ref is the *only* condition defined in an if statement,
#   then that job/step will not run
