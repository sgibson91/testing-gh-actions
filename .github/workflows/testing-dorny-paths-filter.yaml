  # This job inspects changed files in order to determine which cluster files
  # should be validated. If helm-chart files change, then all clusters will be
  # validated. The output of this job is a json-encoded dictionary of the
  # cluster names to be validated. This is passed to the
  # validate-helm-charts-values-files job to define a matrix strategy
